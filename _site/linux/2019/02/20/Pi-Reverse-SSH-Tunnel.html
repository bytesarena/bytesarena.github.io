<p>20 Feb 2019 </p> 
<div class="blog"><p>I have a raspberry pi running at home taking care of some home networking/automation stuff. I may at times find myself in a need to log into the Pi while not at home to check up on things. 
Without a dedicated public IP address this often proved a difficult task. Earlier I was using an ngrok tunnel for this. Read more about ngrok <a href="https://ngrok.com/">here</a>.
The problem with this was that ngrok would give me a different URL every time the Pi reboots. To get around this, I was using a system where I would send an email to a gmail account set up specifically for the Pi and the Pi would respond back with the ngrok URL. I will write a post about this later and link it here. 
Since I ran into some issues with this, I decided to go a different route which this article is about.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-reverse-ssh-tunnel">Using a reverse SSH tunnel.</h2>

<p>To access your home server from anywhere in the world, you would need a middleman SSH server on the cloud. For this, I have setup an instance on AWS. 
If you are new to AWS, you can basically setup an instance for free (there are caveats, read about it <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">here</a>).</p>

<p>I used an Ubuntu 18.04 image that was eligible for free tier usage in AWS.</p>

<p>The basics of how a reverse SSH tunnel works is this.</p>

<p>By creating a reverse SSH tunnel from the local machine(Raspberry pi at home) to the middleman server(AWS instance), you are creating a tunnel for the middle man server to connect back to the local machine. Essentially, you are mapping a socket(combination of an IP address and a port number) on the remote machine to a socket on the local machine. 
 Through this connection, you will be able to SSH from the remote machine to the local machine even though the local machine may be behind a NAT device.</p>

<p>## Basic Architecture</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33704221/48302454-2d371200-e523-11e8-9ad5-8415ac89712a.png" alt="reverse tunnel" /></p>

<p>## How its done.</p>

<p>Here is how you can create a reverse ssh tunnel from the local machine to the remote machine.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> ssh -R 7070:localhost:22 root@&lt;ip of aws instance&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s examine the above example.</p>

<p>Here we used the <strong><em>-R</em></strong> flag to specify remote entry point. The exact syntax of using this is <strong><em>-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport</em></strong>. In our case this would be localhost:7070:localhost:22. The first <strong><em>localhost</em></strong> is the address on the remote machine where the remote entrypoint should be. We skipped this in the example because it is by default localhost. The <strong><em>port 7070</em></strong> is the TCP port on the remote machine which will listen for SSH connections to the local machine. The next <strong><em>localhost</em></strong> refers to the local machine from which the tunnel is created. The <strong><em>port 22</em></strong> at the end is the local port (default SSH port) to which connections will be forwarded from port  7070 on the remote host.</p>

<p>Once the tunnel is created,You can see the remote machine listening on TCP port 7070 with netstat run on the remote machine.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>netstat -tnlp| grep 7070
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:7070            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1621/sshd: root@pts
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>you can SSH into the local machine from the remote machine as below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh root@localhost -p 7070
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, we are creating an SSH tunnel from the remote machine(AWS instance) to itself(localhost) on port 7070. This will be connected to the local machine(Raspberry Pi).</p>

<h2 id="additional-requirements">Additional requirements</h2>

<p>What we see above is how a simple reverse SSH tunnel is set up. However, I had some additional requirements to satisfy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The reverse SSH tunnel needed to start when the local machine starts or reboots. It should ideally run as a service.</li>
  <li>The reverse SSH tunnel needed to run in the background, but give me an opportunity to check its status if needed.</li>
  <li>As seen in the above <strong><em>netstat</em></strong> output, the remote machine listens for connections on the remote entrypoint on loopback. This means I will need to SSH into the remote host and then SSH into the local machine. I needed to avoid the extra step.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is how I tackled these problems.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>I first added the SSH keys to the AWS instance on my local machine.</p>
<h6 id="on-local-machine">On local machine</h6>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-keygen
cat aws-ssh-key.pem &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here <em>aws-ssh-keys.pem</em> is the ssh key file downloaded from AWS.</p>
<h4 id="start-as-a-service-on-boot-run-in-the-background-and-allow-checking-status">Start as a service on boot, run in the background and allow checking status</h4>

<h5 id="on-the-local-machine">On the local machine</h5>

<p>I first created a bash script that starts a TMUX session and runs creates the reverse SSH tunnel from it. <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">This</a> is a good place to read up on TMUX. Its definitely worth the read.</p>

<p>Here is the script.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The IP address and SSH port of my AWS instance is redacted for security.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="nv">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"connectoverwatch"</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="k">$(</span>tmux list-sessions | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nv">$n</span><span class="k">)</span> <span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then
        </span>tmux kill-session <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="nv">$n</span>
        tmux new <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="nt">-s</span> <span class="nv">$n</span>
<span class="k">else

        </span>tmux new <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="nt">-s</span> <span class="nv">$n</span>
<span class="k">fi

</span>tmux send-keys <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="nv">$n</span> <span class="s1">'ssh -vvv -Nf  -R 7070:localhost:22  root@xx.xx.xx.xx -p xx &amp;'</span>  C-m                                                                                                                                                                          
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, I borrowed some code from https://github.com/frdmn/service-daemons and made the script into a service named <em>connectoverwatch</em>.</p>

<p>Now I could start and stop the service and it would start with startup.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>service connectoverwatch status
● connectoverwatch.service - LSB: Example
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/connectoverwatch; generated; vendor preset: enabled)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I could also attach to the TMUX session and view the verbose output from my reverse SSH tunnel.</p>

<h4 id="remove-the-additional-step-of-ssh-to-remote-machine-then-ssh-to-local-machine">Remove the additional step of SSH to remote machine, then SSH to local machine.</h4>

<h5 id="on-remote-machine">On remote machine</h5>

<p>The idea here is to bind the remote entry point TCP port to 0.0.0.0 so that I can SSH to the remote host on the remote entrypoint port (7070) and be immediately connected to my local machine.</p>

<p>The defaule SSHD configuration does not allow this.</p>

<p>To do this, i had to unconnect and change the below line in the file <em>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</em>,</p>

<p>From</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#GatewayPorts no
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GatewayPorts yes
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="on-aws">On AWS</h5>

<p>Now that gateway ports is enabled, I needed to let connections over port 7070 reach the AWS instance. Hence I had to edit the <em>Security Group</em> associated with my instance on AWS and add the below.</p>

<p><img width="100%" alt="secgrprule" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33704221/48300854-028c8f80-e50a-11e8-82a9-327934d8617d.png" /></p>

<h5 id="on-the-local-machine-1">On the local machine</h5>

<p>Now, to specify the bind address on the remote entrypoint, I edited the line which creates the tunnel in initial script as below.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
tmux send-keys <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="nv">$n</span> <span class="s1">'ssh -vvv -Nf  -R 0.0.0.0:7070:localhost:22  root@xx.xx.xx.xx -p xx &amp;'</span>  C-m
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, I just added <strong><em>0.0.0.0:</em></strong> to the -R flag.</p>

<h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>

<p>Now, whenever my Raspberry Pi starts, I could SSH to it from anywhere in the world as below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh root@&lt;AWS instance IP&gt; -p 7070
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="additional-info">Additional info</h5>

<p>This same method can be used to create forwarding for other ports from the remote machine to the local machine.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh -vvv -Nf  -R 0.0.0.0:80:localhost:80  root@xx.xx.xx.xx -p xx
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The above example could be used to access a web server running locally behind a NAT device from the internet.</p>

<h5 id="an-example-use-case">An example use case</h5>

<p>An example use case would be using this method to remotely access a home surveilence system securely. Though, if you are doing something like this, I wouldn’t recommend exposing the remote entrypoint port to the internet to avoid the extra step of logging into AWS instance.</p>
