      <h3>Reverse SSH Tunnel</h3>
      <p>20 Feb 2019</p>
      <p><p>I have a raspberry pi running at home taking care of some home networking/automation stuff. I may at times find myself in a need to log into the Pi while not at home to check up on things. 
Without a dedicated public IP address this often proved a difficult task. Earlier I was using an ngrok tunnel for this. Read more about ngrok <a href="https://ngrok.com/">here</a>.
The problem with this was that ngrok would give me a different URL every time the Pi reboots. To get around this, I was using a system where I would send an email to a gmail account set up specifically for the Pi and the Pi would respond back with the ngrok URL. I will write a post about this later and link it here. 
Since I ran into some issues with this, I decided to go a different route which this article is about.</p>

      <h3>DNSSEC Keys and Signing Explained</h3>
      <p>19 Feb 2019</p>
      <p><p>This article describes what happens when a zone is signed with DNSSEC. 
This document helps to understand the concept of zone signing and does not detail the actual steps for signing a zone.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>I have taken some liberties with this article in the interest of simplicity. For full and accurate information, refer DNSSEC      RFCs.
NXDOMAIN validation is not included in this article.</em></p>

<p>Letâ€™s consider an unsigned zone test.com. 
Below is a representation of the zone file with sample records with only the relevant fields.</p>
