## About Site

For years, I have been learning loads of stuff from the Internet for free. 

I owe my career in technology, exclusively to the Internet and a number of brilliant content creators who uphold the spirit of sharing and the philosophy of free and open technology. 
For a while now, I have been feeling the need to give back to the Internet in some small way.

This site, [BytesArena](/) is my attempt at this. 

I will be posting mostly about Linux, DNS, Docker and Scripting here.

If you have any suggestions or questions about the content on this site, please feel free to contact me on [bytesarena@protonmail.com](mailto:bytesarena@protonmail.com) or comment below.
